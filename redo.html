        <p>I hold a bachelor's degree in mathematics and computer science and have years of experience as a 
            private tutor, helping students excel in these subjects. Currently, I am expanding my expertise 
            by studying software development at BYU-Idaho, with a focus on data science. My passion lies in
             solving complex problems through analytical thinking and technology, and I am dedicated to 
             leveraging data-driven insights to make a meaningful impact. Whether teaching or developing
              innovative solutions, I am committed to continuous learning and helping others succeed.
